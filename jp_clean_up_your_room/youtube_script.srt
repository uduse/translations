1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,950
I've been telling people online in

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,950



3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,600
various ways and in lectures that they

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,600



5
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,940
should start fixing up the world by

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,940



7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,530
cleaning up their room and I wanted to

8
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,530



9
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,719
just elaborate on that a little bit

10
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,719



11
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,529
before I get back to the lecture itself

12
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:17,529



13
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:22,600
so as it's become this internet weird

14
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,600



15
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:25,150
internet meme you know and and and it's

16
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,150



17
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,529
a joke and good it's a joke I'm really

18
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,529



19
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,660
happy about the fact that so much of

20
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,660



21
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:30,550
this has got like the leaven of humor

22
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,550



23
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,379
and it's really important because that's

24
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,379



25
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,620
what stops things from degenerating into

26
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,620



27
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:37,870
into conflict humor and let's say you

28
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,870



29
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,340
want to sort out your room and beautify

30
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,340



31
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,870
it because the beauty is also important

32
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,870



33
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,399
and let's say that all you have is just

34
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,399



35
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,800
a little room like you're not rich

36
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:44,800



37
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,270
you're poor and you don't have any power

38
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,270



39
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,100
that's another thing but you've got your

40
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,100



41
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,809
damn room and you've got this space

42
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,809



43
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,239
right in front of you you know that

44
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,239



45
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:54,340
that's a part of the cosmos that you can

46
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,340



47
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,960
come to grips with and you might think

48
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,960



49
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,550
well what's there in front of you right

50
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,550



51
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,590
in front of you and the answer to that

52
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,590



53
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,300
is it depends on how open your eyes are

54
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,300



55
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,760
that that's the proper answer because

56
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,760



57
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,100
you could say and William Blake said

58
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,100



59
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,689
this for example and Aldous Huxley made

60
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,689



61
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,610
comments that were very similar that in

62
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:09,610



63
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:11,860
a transcendent state you can see

64
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,860



65
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,299
infinity in the finite and you might say

66
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,299



67
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,430
well you can say and you can see

68
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:15,430



69
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,110
infinity and what you have within your

70
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,110



71
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,060
grasp if you look and you could say

72
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,060



73
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,580
maybe that's the case with your room and

74
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,580



75
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,670
so you want to clean up your room well

76
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,670



77
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,189
okay how do you do that exactly well a

78
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,189



79
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,619
room is a room is a place to sleep and

80
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:29,619



81
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:30,850
so if you say your room ups properly

82
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:30,850



83
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:32,740
then you figure out how to sleep and

84
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,740



85
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,450
when you should sleep and how you should

86
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,450



87
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,710
sleep and then you figure out when you

88
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,710



89
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,939
should wake up and then you figure out

90
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,939



91
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,110
well what clothes you should wear

92
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,110



93
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,400
because they have to be arranged

94
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,400



95
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,540
properly in your dresser and then you

96
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,540



97
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,890
have to have some place to put your

98
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,890



99
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,790
clothes and if you're gonna have some

100
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,790



101
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,159
clothes you have to figure out what

102
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,159



103
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,329
you're gonna wear those clothes to do

104
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:46,329



105
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,710
right and then that means you have to

106
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,710



107
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:49,840
figure out what you're going to do and

108
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,840



109
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,189
then your room has to serve that purpose

110
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,189



111
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,220
because otherwise it isn't set up

112
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:54,220



113
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:56,409
properly and if it doesn't set up if it

114
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,409



115
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,450
doesn't serve your purposes you will be

116
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,450



117
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:00,579
unhappy and not happy in the room

118
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,579



119
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,909
because the way that we perceive the

120
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:03,909



121
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:07,450
world is as a place to move from point A

122
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,450



123
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:09,640
to point B in and then if the place that

124
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,640



125
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,440
we're in facilitates that movement then

126
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,440



127
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,050
we're happy to be there and if the place

128
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,050



129
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,780
that we're in serves as an obstacle to

130
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,780



131
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,880
that movement

132
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,880



133
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,740
then we're unhappy to be there and so

134
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,740



135
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,270
what it means to set up your room is

136
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,270



137
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,520
that you have to have somewhere to go

138
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,520



139
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,810
that's worthwhile or you can't set up

140
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,810



141
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,810
your room and then your room has to be

142
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,810



143
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,190
set up to facilitate that and then the

144
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,190



145
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,140
next thing is well maybe you have to

146
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,140



147
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,520
make it beautiful but that's not easy

148
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,520



149
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,440
right that means you have to have some

150
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,440



151
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,720
taste and that doesn't mean you have to

152
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,720



153
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,030
have money it doesn't because you can be

154
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,030



155
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,580
garish with money and you can be

156
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,580



157
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,440
tasteful with nothing all you need is

158
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,440



159
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,000
taste and taste beats money when it

160
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,000



161
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,620
comes to beautifying things you know I

162
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,620



163
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,170
mean note that money is trivial because

164
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,170



165
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,510
it's not but taste is crucial and people

166
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,510



167
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,130
who are very artistically oriented can

168
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,130



169
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,230
make beautiful things out of virtually

170
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,230



171
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,790
nothing and not only that the literature

172
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,790



173
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,530
suggests that if you're going to make

174
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,530



175
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,450
beautiful things putting real

176
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,450



177
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,910
constraints on on what you allow

178
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,910



179
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,830
yourself to do facilitates creativity

180
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,830



181
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,569
instead of interfering with it because

182
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,569



183
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,730
let's say you have to make something out

184
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,730



185
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:10,069
of nothing right which I suppose would

186
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,069



187
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,780
be a godly act right you have to make

188
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,780



189
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:13,880
something out of nothing it you have to

190
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,880



191
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,060
be creative in order to do that and so

192
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,060



193
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,440
then to beautify your room means that

194
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,440



195
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,660
you also have to develop your capacity

196
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,660



197
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,680
to be creative and so then you can make

198
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,680



199
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,090
your room shine but then what will

200
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,090



201
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,709
happen is that if your family isn't

202
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,709



203
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,900
together they will interfere with that

204
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,900



205
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,130
you'll interfere with that because you

206
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,130



207
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,630
won't have the discipline to do it

208
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,630



209
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,420
properly but then when you start

210
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,420



211
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,850
building this this this little microcosm

212
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,850



213
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,700
of perfection with what you have at hand

214
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,700



215
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,840
and it'll evoke all the pathologies of

216
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,840



217
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,130
everyone in your household they'll

218
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,130



219
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,570
wonder what the hell you're up to in

220
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,570



221
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,359
there and they won't necessarily be

222
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,359



223
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,430
happy because if you're if they're in a

224
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:49,430



225
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,109
lowly place let's say and so are you and

226
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,109



227
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,540
you're trying to move out of that then

228
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,540



229
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:56,000
the higher you move out of that the more

230
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,000



231
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,230
the place they're in looks bad and you

232
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,230



233
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,720
might say well what they should do is

234
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,720



235
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,220
celebrate your victory over chaos and

236
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,220



237
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,510
evil but that isn't what will happen

238
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,510



239
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,280
what will happen instead is that they

240
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,280



241
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,980
will attempt to pull you back down

242
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,980



243
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,230
they'll attempt to and I mean obviously

244
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,230



245
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,959
all families don't do that but but all

246
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,959



247
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,359
families do that to some degree and some

248
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,359



249
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,220
families do almost nothing but that and

250
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,220



251
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:18,950
so what that means is that if you're

252
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,950



253
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,720
going to organize your room then you're

254
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,720



255
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,090
going to have to confront the devil's in

256
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,090



257
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,680
your house and that's often that's often

258
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,680



259
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,260
a terrifying thing because some of those

260
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,260



261
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,520
Devils have have lineages that go back

262
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,520



263
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,800
many many many

264
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,800



265
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,000
generations and god only knows what you

266
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,000



267
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,389
have to struggle with in order to

268
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,389



269
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,030
overcome that and so and then and so to

270
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:38,030



271
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:40,039
sort your cell phone and to fix up your

272
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,039



273
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:43,310
room is a non trivial matter you know

274
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,310



275
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,659
and you you can do that you'll learn by

276
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,659



277
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,430
doing that and then maybe you'll learn

278
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:46,430



279
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,900
enough by doing that so that you can fix

280
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,900



281
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,610
up your family a little bit and then

282
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,610



283
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,470
having done that you'll have enough

284
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,470



285
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,360
character so that when you try to

286
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,360



287
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,030
operate in the world at your job or

288
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,030



289
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,560
maybe in the broader social spheres that

290
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,560



291
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,030
you'll be a force for good instead of

292
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,030



293
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,819
harm because you'll have learned some

294
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,819



295
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,190
humility by noting just how difficult it

296
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:04,190



297
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:05,930
was to put your damn room together well

298
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,930



299
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,300
and yourself for that matter and so

300
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,300



301
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,220
you'll proceed cautiously with your eyes

302
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,220



303
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,779
open towards the good

304
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,779



305
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,779
[Music]

306
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:15,390



307
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,460
you
