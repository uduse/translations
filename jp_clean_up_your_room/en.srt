00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,591
<font size="9px">I've been telling people online in various ways, and in lectures,</font>

2
00:00:03,591 --> 00:00:07,403
<font size="9px">that they should start fixing up the world by cleaning up their room.</font>

3
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:12,485
<font size="9px">And I wanted to just elaborate on that a little bit before I get back to the lecture itself.</font>

4
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:15,302
<font size="9px">So as it becomes this weird internet meme you know.</font>

5
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:17,456
<font size="9px">And it's a joke. And good, it's a joke.</font>

6
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:24,030
<font size="9px">I'm really happy about the fact that, so much of this has got like the leaven of humor in it and it's really important.</font>

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,118
<font size="9px">Because that's what stops things from degenerating into conflict is humor.</font>

8
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,587
<font size="9px">And let's say you want to sort out your room and beautify it, because the beauty is also important.</font>

9
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:36,570
<font size="9px">And let's say that all you have is just a little room.</font>

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,503
<font size="9px">Like, you're not rich. You're poor.</font>

11
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:41,320
<font size="9px">And you don't have any power, that's another thing.</font>

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,977
<font size="9px">But you've got your damn room.</font>

13
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:45,628
<font size="9px">And you've got this space right in front of you.</font>

14
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,771
<font size="9px">You know, that that's a part of the cosmos that you can come to grips with.</font>

15
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:53,859
<font size="9px">Then you might think, what's there in front of you? Right in front of you?</font>

16
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:58,776
<font size="9px">And the answer to that is it depends on how open your eyes are. That's the proper answer.</font>

17
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:00,157
<font size="9px">Because you could say ...</font>

18
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:05,295
<font size="9px">William Blake* said this for example, and Aldous Huxley made comments that were very similar.</font>

19
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:08,886
<font size="9px">That in a transcendent state, you can see infinity in the finite.</font>

20
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:14,189
<font size="9px">And you might say, well you can say, if you can see infinity in what you have within your grasp.</font>

21
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,890
<font size="9px">If you look and you could say maybe that's the case with your room.</font>

22
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,823
<font size="9px">So, you want to clean up your room.</font>

23
00:01:19,823 --> 00:01:21,977
<font size="9px">Well, okay, how do you do that exactly?</font>

24
00:01:21,977 --> 00:01:23,800
<font size="9px">Well, a room is a place to sleep.</font>

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,009
<font size="9px">And so if you set your room up properly,</font>

26
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,760
<font size="9px">then you figure out how to sleep, and when you should sleep, and how you should sleep.</font>

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,467
<font size="9px">And then, you figure out when you should wake up.</font>

28
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:36,450
<font size="9px">And then, you figure out what clothes you should wear,</font>

29
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,654
<font size="9px">because they have to be arranged properly in your dresser.</font>

30
00:01:39,654 --> 00:01:42,913
<font size="9px">And then, you have to have some place to put your cloth on.</font>

31
00:01:42,913 --> 00:01:48,990
<font size="9px">And if you're gonna have some clothes, then you have to figure out what you're gonna wear those clothes to do.</font>

32
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,078
<font size="9px">Right? And then that means you have to figure out what you're going to do.</font>

33
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:55,619
<font size="9px">And then, your room has to serve that purpose.</font>

34
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,530
<font size="9px">Because otherwise it isn't set up properly. And if it doesn't set up ... if it doesn't serve your purposes,</font>

35
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,126
<font size="9px">you will be unhappy, and not happy in the room.</font>

36
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:09,208
<font size="9px">Because the way that we perceive the world is as a place to move from point A to point B in.</font>

37
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:14,290
<font size="9px">And then, if the place that we're in facilitates that movement then we're happy to be there.</font>

38
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,869
<font size="9px">And if the place that we're in serves as an obstacle to that movement then we're unhappy to be there.</font>

39
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:25,504
<font size="9px">And, so, what it means to set up your room is that you have to have somewhere to go that's worthwhile,</font>

40
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:27,161
<font size="9px">or you can't set up your room.</font>

41
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:30,254
<font size="9px">And then, your room has to be set up to facilitate that.</font>

42
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:35,723
<font size="9px">And then, the next thing is, well, maybe you have to make it beautiful, but that's not easy, right?</font>

43
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,877
<font size="9px">That means you have to have some taste.</font>

44
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:41,026
<font size="9px">And that doesn't mean you have to have money. It doesn't.</font>

45
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:45,169
<font size="9px">Because you can be garish with money, and you can be tasteful with nothing.</font>

46
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:50,196
<font size="9px">All you need is taste, and taste beats money when it comes to beautifying things, you know.</font>

47
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:54,284
<font size="9px">I mean, not that money is trivial, because it's not, but taste is crucial.</font>

48
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:59,643
<font size="9px">And people who are very artistically oriented can make beautiful things out of virtually nothing.</font>

49
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:00,637
<font size="9px">And not only that.</font>

50
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:04,504
<font size="9px">The literature suggests that if you're going to make beautiful things,</font>

51
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:10,691
<font size="9px">putting real constraints on what you allow yourself to do facilitates creativity instead of interfering with it.</font>

52
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,447
<font size="9px">Because, let's say you have to make something out of nothing, right?</font>

53
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,877
<font size="9px">Which I suppose would be a godly act, right?</font>

54
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:21,849
<font size="9px">If you have to make something out of nothing, you have to be creative in order to do that.</font>

55
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:27,870
<font size="9px">And, so, then, it is, to beautify your room means that you also have to develop your capacity to be creative.</font>

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,245
<font size="9px">And, so, then you can make your room shine.</font>

57
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,123
<font size="9px">But then what will happen is that,</font>

58
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:35,437
<font size="9px">if your family isn't together they will interfere with that.</font>

59
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:40,022
<font size="9px">You'll interfere with that because you won't have the discipline to do it properly.</font>

60
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:45,325
<font size="9px">But then when you start building this little microcosm of perfection with what you have at hand,</font>

61
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:49,026
<font size="9px">then it'll evoke all the pathologies of everyone in your household.</font>

62
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:51,843
<font size="9px">They'll wonder what the hell you're up to in there.</font>

63
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:53,831
<font size="9px">And they won't necessarily be happy.</font>

64
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:58,140
<font size="9px">Because, if you're ... if they're in a lowly place, let's say, and so are you.</font>

65
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,239
<font size="9px">And you're trying to move out of that.</font>

66
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,603
<font size="9px">Then, the higher you move out of that, the more the place they're in looks bad.</font>

67
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:09,630
<font size="9px">And you might say, well, what they should do is celebrate your victory over chaos and evil.</font>

68
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,397
<font size="9px">But that isn't what will happen.</font>

69
00:04:11,397 --> 00:04:16,590
<font size="9px">What will happen instead is that they will attempt to pull you back down. They'll attempt to. </font>

70
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,617
<font size="9px">And I mean, obviously, [not all families do that], but all families do that to some degree.</font>

71
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:24,103
<font size="9px">And some families do almost nothing but that.</font>

72
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:27,970
<font size="9px">And so what that means is that, if you're going to organize your room,</font>

73
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,450
<font size="9px">then you're going to have to confront the devils in your house.</font>

74
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,383
<font size="9px">And that's often a terrifying thing</font>

75
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:38,244
<font size="9px">because some of those devils have have lineages that go back many many many generations.</font>

76
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:42,719
<font size="9px">And god only knows what you will have to struggle with in order to overcome that.</font>

77
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:48,519
<font size="9px">And so, and then, and so, to sort yourself out and to fix up your room is a non-trivial matter, you know.</font>

78
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,226
<font size="9px">And, you can do that, you'll learn by doing that.</font>

79
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:56,695
<font size="9px">And then, maybe you'll learn enough by doing that, so that you can fix up your family a little bit.</font>

80
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,844
<font size="9px">And then, having done that, you'll have enough character.</font>

81
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:05,258
<font size="9px">So that when you try to operate in the world, at your job, or maybe in the broader social spheres,</font>

82
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:07,909
<font size="9px">that you'll be a force for good instead of harm.</font>

83
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:13,930
<font size="9px">Because you'll have learned some humility by noting just how difficult it was to put your damn room together.</font>

84
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,918
<font size="9px">Well, and yourself, for that matter.</font>

85
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,840
<font size="9px">And so, you'll proceed cautiously with your eyes open towards the good.</font>
