1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,390
I've been telling people online in

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,950
various ways and in lectures that they

5
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,600
should start fixing up the world by

7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,940
cleaning up their room and I wanted to

9
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,530
just elaborate on that a little bit

11
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,719
before I get back to the lecture itself

13
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:17,529
so as it's become this internet weird

15
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:22,600
internet meme you know and and and it's

17
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,150
a joke and good it's a joke I'm really

19
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,529
happy about the fact that so much of

21
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:28,660
this has got like the leaven of humor

23
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,550
and it's really important because that's

25
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,379
what stops things from degenerating into

27
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:35,620
into conflict humor and let's say you

29
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,870
want to sort out your room and beautify

31
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,340
it because the beauty is also important

33
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,870
and let's say that all you have is just

35
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,399
a little room like you're not rich

37
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,800
you're poor and you don't have any power

39
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,270
that's another thing but you've got your

41
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,100
damn room and you've got this space

43
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,809
right in front of you you know that

45
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:52,239
that's a part of the cosmos that you can

47
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,340
come to grips with and you might think

49
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,960
well what's there in front of you right

51
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,550
in front of you and the answer to that

53
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,590
is it depends on how open your eyes are

55
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,300
that that's the proper answer because

57
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,760
you could say and William Blake said

59
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,100
this for example and Aldous Huxley made

61
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,689
comments that were very similar that in

63
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:09,610
a transcendent state you can see

65
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,860
infinity in the finite and you might say

67
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,299
well you can say and you can see

69
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,430
infinity and what you have within your

71
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,110
grasp if you look and you could say

73
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,060
maybe that's the case with your room and

75
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,580
so you want to clean up your room well

77
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,670
okay how do you do that exactly well a

79
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,189
room is a room is a place to sleep and

81
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,619
so if you say your room ups properly

83
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:30,850
then you figure out how to sleep and

85
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,740
when you should sleep and how you should

87
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,450
sleep and then you figure out when you

89
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,710
should wake up and then you figure out

91
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,939
well what clothes you should wear

93
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,110
because they have to be arranged

95
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,400
properly in your dresser and then you

97
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,540
have to have some place to put your

99
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,890
clothes and if you're gonna have some

101
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,790
clothes you have to figure out what

103
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,159
you're gonna wear those clothes to do

105
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,329
right and then that means you have to

107
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,710
figure out what you're going to do and

109
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,840
then your room has to serve that purpose

111
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,189
because otherwise it isn't set up

113
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:54,220
properly and if it doesn't set up if it

115
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,409
doesn't serve your purposes you will be

117
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,450
unhappy and not happy in the room

119
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,579
because the way that we perceive the

121
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,909
world is as a place to move from point A

123
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,450
to point B in and then if the place that

125
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,640
we're in facilitates that movement then

127
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,440
we're happy to be there and if the place

129
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,050
that we're in serves as an obstacle to

131
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,780
that movement

133
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,880
then we're unhappy to be there and so

135
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,740
what it means to set up your room is

137
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,270
that you have to have somewhere to go

139
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,520
that's worthwhile or you can't set up

141
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,810
your room and then your room has to be

143
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,810
set up to facilitate that and then the

145
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,190
next thing is well maybe you have to

147
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,140
make it beautiful but that's not easy

149
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,520
right that means you have to have some

151
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,440
taste and that doesn't mean you have to

153
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,720
have money it doesn't because you can be

155
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,030
garish with money and you can be

157
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,580
tasteful with nothing all you need is

159
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,440
taste and taste beats money when it

161
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,000
comes to beautifying things you know I

163
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,620
mean note that money is trivial because

165
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,170
it's not but taste is crucial and people

167
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,510
who are very artistically oriented can

169
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,130
make beautiful things out of virtually

171
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,230
nothing and not only that the literature

173
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,790
suggests that if you're going to make

175
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,530
beautiful things putting real

177
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,450
constraints on on what you allow

179
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,910
yourself to do facilitates creativity

181
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,830
instead of interfering with it because

183
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,569
let's say you have to make something out

185
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:07,730
of nothing right which I suppose would

187
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,069
be a godly act right you have to make

189
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:11,780
something out of nothing it you have to

191
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,880
be creative in order to do that and so

193
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,060
then to beautify your room means that

195
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,440
you also have to develop your capacity

197
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,660
to be creative and so then you can make

199
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,680
your room shine but then what will

201
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,090
happen is that if your family isn't

203
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,709
together they will interfere with that

205
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,900
you'll interfere with that because you

207
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,130
won't have the discipline to do it

209
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,630
properly but then when you start

211
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,420
building this this this little microcosm

213
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,850
of perfection with what you have at hand

215
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,700
and it'll evoke all the pathologies of

217
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,840
everyone in your household they'll

219
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,130
wonder what the hell you're up to in

221
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,570
there and they won't necessarily be

223
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,359
happy because if you're if they're in a

225
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,430
lowly place let's say and so are you and

227
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,109
you're trying to move out of that then

229
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:53,540
the higher you move out of that the more

231
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,000
the place they're in looks bad and you

233
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,230
might say well what they should do is

235
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,720
celebrate your victory over chaos and

237
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,220
evil but that isn't what will happen

239
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,510
what will happen instead is that they

241
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,280
will attempt to pull you back down

243
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,980
they'll attempt to and I mean obviously

245
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,230
all families don't do that but but all

247
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,959
families do that to some degree and some

249
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,359
families do almost nothing but that and

251
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,220
so what that means is that if you're

253
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,950
going to organize your room then you're

255
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,720
going to have to confront the devil's in

257
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,090
your house and that's often that's often

259
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,680
a terrifying thing because some of those

261
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,260
Devils have have lineages that go back

263
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,520
many many many

265
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,800
generations and god only knows what you

267
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
have to struggle with in order to

269
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,389
overcome that and so and then and so to

271
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:38,030
sort your cell phone and to fix up your

273
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,039
room is a non trivial matter you know

275
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:43,310
and you you can do that you'll learn by

277
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,659
doing that and then maybe you'll learn

279
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,430
enough by doing that so that you can fix

281
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,900
up your family a little bit and then

283
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,610
having done that you'll have enough

285
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,470
character so that when you try to

287
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,360
operate in the world at your job or

289
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,030
maybe in the broader social spheres that

291
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,560
you'll be a force for good instead of

293
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,030
harm because you'll have learned some

295
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,819
humility by noting just how difficult it

297
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:04,190
was to put your damn room together well

299
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,930
and yourself for that matter and so

301
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,300
you'll proceed cautiously with your eyes

303
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,220
open towards the good

305
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,400
[Music]
